Important concepts
------------------

The dpuniverse/ directory
    Your universe is constructed from objects in the dpuniverse/ directory.
    The dpuniverse/ directory contains subdirectories for pages, non playing
    characters and other objects: dpuniverse/page/, dpuniverse/npc/ and
    dpuniverse/obj/.

Filename based classes
    Each .php file within dpuniverse/ should contain only one class, with the
    classname the same as the filename, without .php, and the first letter in
    upper case. For example:

    /page/bar.php defines class Bar

    Class names must be unique. See doc/8_issues.txt for more information about
    this limitation.

The universe object
    The universe object keeps track of all objects in the game and sports a
    number of important methods you can call.

    A reference to the universe object is obtained by the
    get_current_dbuniverse method.

    Example:
    $universe = get_current_dbuniverse();
    $note = $universe->newDpObject('/obj/note.php');

    See 3_universe.txt for a list of callable methods.

The standard class
    Each object extends on the DpObject class from dpuniverse/std/DpObject.php,
    either directly, or by using a class that extends on it.

Other standard classes
    Other standard classes provide several building blocks for your site:
    DpPage to make a page;
    DpNpc to make a non playing character (a bot);
    DpDrink to make a drink.

    They all extend on DpObject.

Inventory, environment
    Objects can "contain" other objects. You can call the getEnvironment
    and getInventory methods in all objects to see how they are related to
    the objects surrounding them or contained in them:

    /* List of what the user is carrying */
    $inv = $user->getInventory();
    foreach ($inv as &$ob) {
        get_current_dpuser()->tell($ob->getTitle() . '<br />');
    }

    $env = $note->getEnvironment();
    if ($env->getProperty('is_page')) {
       ... /* The note is sitting on the page */
    } elseif ($env->getProperty('is_user')) {
       ... /* Someone is carrying the note */
    }

Moving objects
    Call moveDpObject in objects to move them around, for example:

    $note->moveDpObject($user);          /* Moves note to inventory of user */
    $note->moveDpObject($user->getEnvironment());     /* Moves note to page */
