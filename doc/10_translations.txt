DutchPIPE now has some basic internationalization (I18N) and
localization (L10N) support.

Currently, it is only possible to run a DutchPIPE site either in one
language or the other: it is not yet possible for one user to see a
page in one language and another user on the same page another
language.

You must enable I18N/L10N in config/dpserver-ini.php.

Currently, there are two languages/regions:
English (the default)
Dutch/The Netherlands

To make a new translation, make a directory in locale/ equal to the
locale/en/ subdirectory tree, using the right language/region code in
the same format as the nl_NL directory.

This isn't a manual to gettext, start at http://www.php.net/gettext
for PHP gettext documentation, pointers to GNU gettext documentation
and links to language/region codes.

Then edit the translation table located at:
locale/<your dir>/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po.

To complete, run:
msgfmt messages.po
in that directory, and a new messages.mo is created.

Then translate text files such as HTML files for pages and place them
in locale/<yourdir>/ using the same directory structure as under
dpuniverse/ where the original English versions can be found.
For example, the Dutch translation for dpuniverse/page/index.html can
be found in locale/nl_NL/page/index.html.

All translations are optional, if you don't provide a line in
messages.po or a text file, the English version is used, or whatever
language you use when adding new stuff.

You don't need to add to messages.po or put files such as index.html
in locale if you don't plan to contribute code to DutchPIPE and don't
plan to provide more language options on your site in the future.
In that case, just code your new objects and pages in the new
language. Bits in English from the core system will be translated,
and new stuff already in your language won't be touched.

Although gettext is fast, it has of course a speed penalty and it is
turned off by default in config/dpserver-ini.php. You won't notice
under normal circumstances, but if you have a very busy server you'll
hit your capacity ceiling sooner.

If you have a new translation, please contribute it!

Todo:
- Split messages.po into core translation and one or more other files.
- A system to add stuff easily (better than msgmerge in one big file).
- Multiple-languages within one site.
- Provide static translations plus tools, for speed optimalization
