1. DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL DUTCHPIPE

    Download DutchPIPE from:
    http://dutchpipe.org/dpclient.php?location=/page/download.php

    Extract the files in c:\ so you now have the directory:
    c:\dutchpipe\

2. DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL WAMP5

    Download WAMP5 from http://www.wampserver.com/en/download.php

    Launch what you have downloaded to start the installation process

    You can choose the installation folder. This step-by-step guide uses
    the default choice, c:\wamp

    You can choose to auto launch WAMP5 at startup, we didn't do that.

    You can choose, if this is your first WAMP5 install, what directory
    contains your homepage. Choose c:\dutchpipe\public

    You can choose whether you want to start WAMP5. Choose yes.

3. CONFIGURE WAMP5

    Now WAMP5 is running, an icon appeared on your tray bar at the bottom
    right of your screen.

    Click on the WAMP5 tray bar icon and select:
    PHP extensions -> php_sockets
    so that php_sockets is enabled

    Click on the WAMP5 tray bar icon and select:
    Config files -> httpd.conf

    Notepad or your editor is launched. Search for the line:
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.php3 index.html index.htm index.html.var
    and change it to
    DirectoryIndex dpclient.php index.php index.php3 index.html index.htm index.html.var

    Save the file.

4. CONFIGURE DUTCHPIPE

    Launch c:\dutchpipe\config\setupmysql.sql and select & copy all text.

    Click on the WAMP5 tray bar icon and select:
    MySQL -> MySQL console

    Your password is still empty if this is your first install, press RETURN.

    Click on the top left part of the console window, and select from the menu:
    Edit -> Paste

    You can now close the MySQL console window.

    Edit c:\dutchpipe\config\dpserver-ini.php

    Change the first pair of define's:
    define('DPSERVER_HOST_URL', 'http://www.yourdomain.com');
    //define('DPSERVER_HOST_URL', 'http://localhost');
    to this:
    //define('DPSERVER_HOST_URL', 'http://www.yourdomain.com');
    define('DPSERVER_HOST_URL', 'http://localhost');

    Change these two lines:
    define('DPSERVER_SOCKET_TYPE', AF_UNIX);
    //define('DPSERVER_SOCKET_TYPE', AF_INET);
    into:
    define('DPSERVER_SOCKET_TYPE', AF_UNIX);
    //define('DPSERVER_SOCKET_TYPE', AF_INET);

    Check if the DPSERVER_SOCKET_PORT is a free port on your machine (3333 by
    default). Change if necessary.

    Save the file.

    Edit c:\dutchpipe\config\dpuniverse-ini.php

    Change these two lines:
    define('DPUNIVERSE_MYSQL_USER', '<youruser>');
    define('DPUNIVERSE_MYSQL_PASSWORD', '<yourpass>');
    into
    define('DPUNIVERSE_MYSQL_USER', 'root');
    define('DPUNIVERSE_MYSQL_PASSWORD', '');

    You should later secure MySQL by running the DutchPIPE database with
    another user and a password, but we're now just getting up DutchPIPE
    locally.

    Save the file.

5. RESTART WAMP5

   Click on the WAMP5 tray bar icon and select at the bottom:
   Restart All Services

6. START DUTCHPIPE SERVER

   Launch a command prompt window.

   CD to this directory:
   cd c:\dutchpipe\script

   Enter the following line:
   c:\wamp\php\php.exe -c c:\wamp\apache2\bin c:\dutchpipe\script\start_dpserver.php

   The DutchPIPE server is now running

7. DONE

   Launch your web browser and go to http://localhost/

   You should see the standard DutchPIOPE environment.
