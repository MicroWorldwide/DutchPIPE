GLOBAL FUNCTIONS
    The following functions are globally defined and can be called everywhere.

    /**
     * Gets the current user connected to the server
     *
     * If a user page or AJAX request caused the current chain of execution that
     * caused this function to be called, that user object is returned. Otherwise
     * FALSE is returned. For example, if the chain of execution if caused by a
     * setTimeout, this will return FALSE.
     *
     * @return     object    Reference to user object of FALSE for no current user
     */

    /**
     * Gets the current object performing an action
     *
     * This can also be a computer controlled character. If the chain of execution
     * that caused this function to be called isn't the result of a user or npc
     * performing an action, FALSE is returned.
     *
     * If the current object is a user performing an action, get_current_dpobject
     * doesn't necessarily equal get_current_dpuser. Someone or something might
     * force the user the perform an action.

     * as newDpObject. Usually and currently there's just the one universe object.
     * In the future there might be more, for instance to allow users to switch
     * between different worlds without having to log in again.
