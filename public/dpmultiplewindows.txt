It is currently not possible to have multiple windows opened at DutchPIPE.org.
DutchPIPE will support this as an option in the near future in the form of a
"Clone of <your name>" avatar or something similar.

If you get this message BUT YOU HAVEN'T GOT MULTIPLE WINDOWS OPENED, please
let us know at bugs@dutchpipe.org. Thanks!
