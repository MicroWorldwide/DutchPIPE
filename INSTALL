INTRODUCTION

    Before installing DutchPIPE, please read the README file.

    This document lists some possible platforms and configurations, but
    obviously not all of them. DutchPIPE is platform independent software, and
    you should be able to install it on any computer or server that runs a web
    server, PHP 5 and a database (a number of databases are supported).

REQUIREMENTS FOR USING AND INSTALLING DUTCHPIPE

    Skill Requirements:

    1. PHP 5

       Knowledge of PHP 5 and in particular PHP 5 objects. However, if you have
       PHP 4 experience only, DutchPIPE is an excellent project to learn more
       about PHP 5.

    2. Javascript/AJAX

       If you like more magic to happen than the current library provides,
       Javascript/AJAX knowledge is required. As with PHP 5, DutchPIPE is a
       great project to get skilled with AJAX.

    Software Requirements:

    1. A *NIX or Windows platform

       DutchPIPE was developed and tested on FreeBSD 6. You must have full
       access to a computer or server to run DutchPIPE. I also installed it
       successfully on a Windows XP box, using http://www.wampserver.com/en/ to
       install Apache, PHP and MySQL.

       DutchPIPE was developed and tested on FreeBSD 6. You must have full
       access to a computer or server to run DutchPIPE. You can also run it from
       a Windows machine, for example using
       {@link http://www.wampserver.com/en/} to install Apache, PHP and MySQL,
       or using IIS and Microsoft SQL Server.

    2. A web server

       You should be able to use any web server with PHP 5 support, such as
       Apache, IIS and lighttpd. DutchPIPE.org runs on Apache 2.2, it was also
       successfully tested on IIS.

    3. PHP 5 with the extensions: simple_xml and sockets (both for the web
       server and "on the command line")

       DutchPIPE.org is currently running PHP 5.2.3. The simple_xml extension is
       supported by default in PHP 5.

       To enable the avatar upload feature the gd extension is required. The gd
       extension also makes image handling a bit faster.

    4. A database

       DutchPIPE supports MySQL, MySQLi, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Frontbase,
       Querysim, Interbase/Firebird, MSSQL and SQLite.

    5. An AJAX capable web browser

       The following web browser versions are supported 100%: Firefox 1 and 2,
       Internet Explorer 6 and 7, Opera 9 are Safari 3.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING DUTCHPIPE ON LINUX, BSD, UNIX, ...

    1. Obtain the DutchPIPE software

       Download the DutchPIPE distribution from:

       http://download.dutchpipe.org/

       You can either download the packed .zip or .tgz file.

    2. Unpack the DutchPIPE software

       Unpack to the directory of your choice. In this example installation, we
       unpack to:

       /path/to/dutchpipe

       Relative paths in the remainder of these instructions are from the top of
       this path.

    3. Configure the DutchPIPE software

       You must patch these settings files:

       config/dpserver-ini.php
       config/dpuniverse-ini.php

       Follow the instructions in these files or see entries in the DutchPIPE
       Manual for dpserver-ini.php and dpuniverse-ini.php.

       Make sure the first line of

       script/start_dpserver.php

       refers to the PHP command line installation. Make sure this file is
       executable (see man chmod under *NIX).

    4. Set up the database

       Make sure the first line of

       script/setupdb.php

       refers to the PHP command line installation. Make sure this file is
       executable (see man chmod under *NIX).

       Run the script by entering in the shell:

       script/setupdb.php

       This script does not (yet) update an old installation. If you don't want
       to lose data, use a different database name in dpuniverse-ini.php.

    5. Configure your web server

       If you already have a location to test DutchPIPE, you can skip step 5 and
       6.

       Decide on what URL you want to host your DutchPIPE installation. You need
       to let your web server know where to find the directory with the
       DutchPIPE public files.

       There are many ways to add DutchPIPE, this is just one of them. In the
       example case, we added the following to the vhosts configuration file of
       Apache 2.2 in our FreeBSD 6 installation:

       /usr/local/etc/apache22/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

       <VirtualHost *:80>
           ServerAdmin webmaster@yourdomain.com
           DocumentRoot /path/to/dutchpipe/public
           ServerName www.yourdomain.com
           <Directory "/path/to/dutchpipe/public">
               DirectoryIndex dpclient.php
               Options All
               AllowOverride All
               AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
               Order allow,deny
               Allow from all
           </Directory>
       </VirtualHost>

    6. Restart your web server

       For the example case, enter in the shell:

       /usr/local/etc/rc.d/apache22.sh restart

    7. Start the DutchPIPE server

       For the example case, enter in the shell:

       cd script
       ./start_dpserver.php

       It will output some memory and debug information, so you might want to
       try, for example:

       ./start_dpserver.php > mylog &

       to throw everything in a log file called mylog and run the process in the
       background.

       There is no proper restart script yet. Simply kill the process and start
       the script again to restart the server.

    8. Browse to your DutchPIPE public installation

       In the example case: http://demo.dutchpipe.org/

       You should now see an example DutchPIPE installation in your browser.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING DUTCHPIPE ON WINDOWS 2000, XP, ...

    These instructions are for use in combination with WAMP5, a software
    distribution that installs the Apache web server, MySQL and PHP 5 for
    Windows.

    However, you can also install DutchPIPE with separate or other web server,
    database and PHP 5 installations, for example IIS in combination with
    Microsoft SQL Server. This procedure just uses WAMP5 as an example and
    because of its fast, user friendly set-up.

    1. Obtain the DutchPIPE software

       Download the DutchPIPE distribution from:

       http://download.dutchpipe.org/

       You can either download the packed .zip or .tgz file.

    2. Unpack the DutchPIPE software

       Extract the files in c:\ so you now have the directory:

       c:\dutchpipe

    3. Download and Install WAMP5

       Download WAMP5 from:

       http://www.wampserver.com/en/download.php

       Launch what you have downloaded to start the installation
       process.

       You can choose the installation folder. This step-by-step guide uses the
       default choice:

       c:\wamp

       You can choose to auto launch WAMP5 at startup, we didn't do that.

       You can choose, if this is your first WAMP5 install, what directory
       contains your DocumentRoot. Choose:

       c:\dutchpipe\public

       You can choose whether you want to start WAMP5. Choose yes.

    4. Configure WAMP5

       Now WAMP5 is running, an icon appeared on your tray bar at the bottom
       right of your screen.

       Click on the WAMP5 tray bar icon and select:

       PHP settings -> PHP extensions -> php_sockets

       so that php_sockets is enabled.

       To enable the avatar upload feature and in general faster image handling,
       select:

       PHP settings -> PHP extensions -> php_gd2

       so that php_gd2 is enabled.

       Click on the WAMP5 tray bar icon and select:

       Config files -> httpd.conf

       Notepad or your text editor is launched. Search for the line:

       DirectoryIndex index.php index.php3 index.html index.htm index.html.var

       and change it to

       DirectoryIndex dpclient.php index.php index.php3 index.html index.htm index.html.var

       Save the file.

    5. Configure DutchPIPE

       Edit the following file:

       c:\dutchpipe\config\dpserver-ini.php

       Change the first pair of define's:

       define('DPSERVER_HOST_URL', 'http://www.yourdomain.com');
       //define('DPSERVER_HOST_URL', 'http://localhost');

       to this:

       //define('DPSERVER_HOST_URL', 'http://www.yourdomain.com');
       define('DPSERVER_HOST_URL', 'http://localhost');

       Check if the DPSERVER_SOCKET_PORT is a free port on your machine (3333 by
       default):

       define('DPSERVER_SOCKET_PORT', '3333');

       Change the port number if necessary.

       Save the file.

       Edit the following file:

       c:\dutchpipe\config\dpuniverse-ini.php

       Change these two lines by supplying a MySQL user and password:

       define('DPUNIVERSE_MYSQL_USER', '<youruser>');
       define('DPUNIVERSE_MYSQL_PASSWORD', '<yourpass>');

       Out of the box MySQL has been set up with a user 'root' and an empty
       password '', which you can use if you quickly want to complete setup, but
       in this case you should later secure MySQL by running the DutchPIPE
       database with another user and a password.

       Check out and configure the $DPUNIVERSE_MDB2_* variables in
       dpuniverse-ini.php if you want to use a different database.

       Save the file.

    6. Setup the database

       Select at the bottom left of your screen:

       Start -> Run...

       and enter the following line:

       c:\wamp\php\php.exe -c c:\wamp\apache2\bin c:\dutchpipe\script\setupdb.php

       This script does not (yet) update an old installation. If you don't want
       to lose data, use a different database name in dpuniverse-ini.php.

    7. Restart WAMP5

       Click on the WAMP5 tray bar icon and select at the bottom:

       Restart All Services

    8. Start the DutchPIPE Server

       Select at the bottom left of your screen:

       Start -> Run...

       and enter the following line:

       c:\wamp\php\php.exe -c c:\wamp\apache2\bin c:\dutchpipe\script\start_dpserver.php

       The DutchPIPE server is now running in a Command Prompt window.

    9. Done

       Launch your web browser and go to:

       http://localhost/

       You should see the standard DutchPIPE environment, exactly like the demo
       on:

       http://demo.dutchpipe.org/
