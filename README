WELCOME TO DUTCHPIPE

    With open source DutchPIPE software, web developers can make
    virtual multi-user environments. Each web page becomes an
    abstracted environment or location where visitors and other items
    on the page are visualized. This status is retained as visitors
    move around. A lot of real-time interaction is possible. The
    result: Persistent Interactive Page Environments. DutchPIPE uses
    AJAX and the DOM for the browser - it works without Java, Flash,
    plug-in or firewall adjustments. On the server, PHP 5 is used.

WARNING

    This is unfinished "alpha" software. It is not for the faint of
    heart. Both code and documentation are in alpha status. This is
    the work of one man, in four months, after work. There will be
    bugs, issues, and even plain unfinished parts. Some parts are
    quite clean, others still the result of organic growth. This
    release is aimed at those interested to play around with it, to
    increase interest, get bug reports, attract contributors, and all
    that.

    You should be aware that DutchPIPE is not secure yet, if there is
    such a thing. For example, the AJAX engine uses lazy GETs all over
    the place, even when POSTs should be used, and the consequences of
    tinkering these requests have not been fully explored or closed
    yet. In other words: Only use this alpha software if you know what
    you are doing. Try this on a test machine, not your public company
    server with other sites or anything like that.

INSTALLATION

    See the INSTALL file for installation requirements and step-by-
    step guides for both *NIX and Windows platforms.

        Templates for building XHTML pages

TROUBLESHOOTING/GETTING HELP/GIVING FEEDBACK

    I'll try to test usage on as many platforms as possible to allow
    for painless installation, but obviously I didn't have much time
    for that yet. Since this is all new and tested on a limited number
    of platforms, with lack of documentation, feel welcome to share
    your experiences or particular pains and problems with the
    DutchPIPE installation.

    See the MANUAL, DEVELOPER'S LOUNGE, MAILING LISTS and THE AUTHOR
    sections below for information and contact details. If you solved
    a particular installation problem, or installed it successfully in
    a previously untested platform, please also let me know, so I can
    update the documentation.

MANUAL

    The DutchPIPE Manual is the DutchPIPE's developer prime source
    of information:

    http://manual.dutchpipe.org/

    This README file and the INSTALL file are copies from the
    manual's Introduction and Installation chapters, you might prefer
    the HTML pages.

MAILING LISTS

    There are a number of DutchPIPE mailing lists, for instance to
    talk about DutchPIPE or to discuss installation problems. For an
    overview and to (un)subscribe, browse to:

    If you're a serious developer, dutchpipe-talk is the best way to
    discuss issues.

THE AUTHOR

    DutchPIPE was made by Lennert Stock. Feel free to send comments
    and bug reports to the author at:

ROADMAP

    Well there isn't exactly a roadmap yet, but here are just -a few-
    of the things on the wish list.

    First of all I must spend some time on non-coding issues so I can
    properly start this project up. Provide proper documentation so
    people can, eh, actually use it, provide the usual tools such as
    bug trackers and subversion access, and market the thing if
    necessary, although I'm hoping you pass the word though.

    The interface is still crude and must be made more user friendly.
    The verb noun commands should only remain for power users and
    under the hood, input fields for communications should pop up or
    whatever.

    Debugging and making DutchPIPE more secure.

    Movable or even animated objects.

    Debugging and enhancements on running DutchPIPE on .html pages.
    Making it possible to run DutchPIPE on pages on another server.
    For this we need a proxy script to forward AJAX requests as AJAX
    cannot be used across domains for security reasons.

    Make options to let visitors make their own objects and "area".

    Distributed DutchPIPE: Make it possible for DutchPIPE sites to
    see, communicate and switch to other DutchPIPE sites, making it
    one big, sprawling universe.

    Better dpuniverse/std library. The library provided for the
    universe is very basic now, and lots of functionality will be
    added.

    More showcases.

    Learn English/learn how to spell.

    Et cetera, et cetera. Of course this can't be done by one man, so
    if you'd like any of the above or any other ideas implemented,
    please read on...

CONTRIBUTING

    DutchPIPE is a brand new, fresh open source project. If you'd like
    to contribute in any way, be it code, bugs, documentation, or open
    source experience such as project setup and management, please
    mail ls@dutchpipe.org. The DutchPIPE "noosphere" is huge and for the
    taking. This will be a free project in any sense, if you shine at
    some particular skill or knowledge, you'll be able to pretty much
    give it shape any way you please. Again, this project is fresh.
    If you like established projects with all the tools firmly in
    place, DutchPIPE is not for you. However, if you're full of
    inspiration and just like to code, no one is in your way, no one
    has done it yet and probably no one is even planning it. You keep
    the copyright of your OS licensed contributions and are fully
    credited for your efforts. Also, if you disliked certain things or
    setups in other projects which appear to be written in stone, this
    is your change to make your mark and make your experience count.
