<h1>DutchPIPE Showcases</h1><br />
<p align="justify" class="notop">
In addition to this whole site which is an example of a DutchPIPE environment,
we'll be slowly adding showcases here to demonstrate different possibilities
(see <a
href="{DPSERVER_CLIENT_URL}?location={DPUNIVERSE_PAGE_PATH}about.php">About
DutchPIPE</a>). We are now concentrating on the core AJAX/PHP system, and these
showcases will be simple proof of concepts, but over time as the system matures,
more complex (and more exciting!) showcases will appear.</p>

<div style="padding-left: 10px">Within the DutchPIPE framework you can create
powerful page environments with URLs as seen in the address field of your
browser. Here's an example that skips the framework and just adds DutchPIPE
functionality to a set of existing .html pages, just by including one
javascript in each page.</div>
