REQUIREMENTS FOR USING AND INSTALLING DUTCHPIPE

    Skill Requirements:

    1. PHP 5

       Knowledge of PHP 5 and in particular PHP 5 objects. However, if
       you have PHP 4 experience only, DutchPIPE is an excellent
       project to learn more about PHP 5.

    2. Javascript/AJAX

       If you like more magic to happen than the current library
       provides, Javascript/AJAX knowledge is required. As with PHP 5,
       DutchPIPE is a great project to get skilled with AJAX.

    Software Requirements:

    1. A *NIX or Windows platform

       DutchPIPE was developed and tested on FreeBSD 6. You must have
       full access to a computer or server to run DutchPIPE. I also
       installed it successfully on a Windows XP box, using
       http://www.wampserver.com/en/ to install Apache, PHP and MySQL.

    2. A web server

       DutchPIPE.org runs on Apache 2.2, I haven't been able to test
       on other servers yet.

    3. PHP 5 with the extensions: simple_xml and sockets (both for the
       web server and &quot;on the command line&quot;)

       DutchPIPE.org has been using PHP 5.1+. The simple_xml extension
       is supported by default on PHP 5.

    4. MySQL

       Used to store registered users. There are just a few queries,
       more databases will be supported later. If you don't have MySQL
       you can still test DutchPIPE if you rip some queries out, you
       just can't register.

    5. An AJAX capable web browser

       Currently Firefox, IE6 and IE7 beta 2 are supported 100%. Opera
       and Safari will be supported as soon as possible. If you can
       help test on Safari, please contact me.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING DUTCHPIPE ON LINUX, BSD, UNIX, ...

    1. Obtain the DutchPIPE software

       Download the DutchPIPE distribution from:

       http://download.dutchpipe.org/

       You can either download the packed .zip or .tgz file.

    2. Unpack the DutchPIPE software

       Unpack to the directory of your choice. In this example
       installation, we unpack to:

       /path/to/dutchpipe

       Relative paths in the remainder of these instructions are from
       the top of this path.

    3. Configure the DutchPIPE software

       You must patch these settings files:

       config/dpserver-ini.php
       config/dpuniverse-ini.php

       Follow the instructions in these files or see the manual
       entries for dpserver-ini.php and dpuniverse-ini.php.

       Make sure the first line of

       script/start_dpserver.php

       refers to the PHP command line installation. Make sure this
       file is executable (see man chmod under *NIX).

    4. Setup MySQL

       Create a database called

       dutchpipe

       and import the following SQL:

       config/setupmysql.sql

    5. Configure your web server

       If you already have a location to test DutchPIPE, you can skip
       step 5 and 6.

       Decide on what URL you want to host your DutchPIPE
       installation. You need to let your web server know where to
       find the directory with the DutchPIPE public files.

       There are many ways to add DutchPIPE, this is just one of them.
       In the example case, we added the following to the vhosts
       configuration file of Apache 2.2 in our FreeBSD 6 installation:

       /usr/local/etc/apache22/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

       &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
           ServerAdmin webmaster@yourdomain.com
           DocumentRoot /path/to/dutchpipe/public
           ServerName www.yourdomain.com
           &lt;Directory &quot;/path/to/dutchpipe/public&quot;&gt;
               DirectoryIndex dpclient.php
               Options All
               AllowOverride All
               AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
               Order allow,deny
               Allow from all
           &lt;/Directory&gt;
       &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

    6. Restart your web server

       For the example case:

       /usr/local/etc/rc.d/apache22.sh restart

    7. Start the DutchPIPE server

       For the example case:

       cd scripts
       ./start_dpserver.php

       It will output some memory and debug information, so you might
       want to try, for example:

       ./start_dpserver.php &gt; mylog &amp;

       to throw everything in a log file called mylog and run the
       process in the background.

       There is no proper restart script yet. Simply kill the process
       and start the script again to restart the server.

    8. Browse to your DutchPIPE public installation

       In the example case: http://demo.dutchpipe.org/

       You should now see an example DutchPIPE installation in your
       browser.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING DUTCHPIPE ON WINDOWS 2000, XP, ...

    These instructions are for use in combination with WAMP5, a
    software distribution that installs the Apache web server, MySQL
    and PHP 5 for Windows.

    However, you can also install DutchPIPE with separate or other web
    server, MySQL and PHP 5 installations. This procedure just uses
    WAMP5 as an example and because of its fast, user friendly set-up.

    1. Obtain the DutchPIPE software

       Download the DutchPIPE distribution from:

       http://download.dutchpipe.org/

       You can either download the packed .zip or .tgz file.

    2. Unpack the DutchPIPE software

       Extract the files in c:\ so you now have the directory:

       c:\dutchpipe

    3. Download and Install WAMP5

       Download WAMP5 from:

       http://www.wampserver.com/en/download.php

       Launch what you have downloaded to start the installation
       process.

       You can choose the installation folder. This step-by-step guide
       uses the default choice:

       c:\wamp

       You can choose to auto launch WAMP5 at startup, we didn't do
       that.

       You can choose, if this is your first WAMP5 install, what
       directory contains your DocumentRoot. Choose:

       c:\dutchpipe\public

       You can choose whether you want to start WAMP5. Choose yes.

    4. Configure WAMP5

       Now WAMP5 is running, an icon appeared on your tray bar at the
       bottom right of your screen.

       Click on the WAMP5 tray bar icon and select:

       PHP extensions -&gt; php_sockets

       so that php_sockets is enabled.

       Click on the WAMP5 tray bar icon and select:

       Config files -&gt; httpd.conf

       Notepad or your text editor is launched. Search for the line:

       DirectoryIndex index.php index.php3 index.html index.htm index.html.var

       and change it to

       DirectoryIndex dpclient.php index.php index.php3 index.html index.htm index.html.var

       Save the file.

    5. Configure DutchPIPE

       Open the following file in a text editor (notepad for example):

       c:\dutchpipe\config\setupmysql.sql

       and select &amp; copy all text.

       Click on the WAMP5 tray bar icon and select:

       MySQL -&gt; MySQL console

       Your password is still empty if this is your first install,
       press RETURN.

       Click on the top left part of the console window, and select
       from the menu:

       Edit -&gt; Paste

       You can now close the MySQL console window.

       Edit the following file:

       c:\dutchpipe\config\dpserver-ini.php

       Change the first pair of define's:

       define('DPSERVER_HOST_URL', 'http://www.yourdomain.com');
       //define('DPSERVER_HOST_URL', 'http://localhost');

       to this:

       //define('DPSERVER_HOST_URL', 'http://www.yourdomain.com');
       define('DPSERVER_HOST_URL', 'http://localhost');

       Change these two lines:

       define('DPSERVER_SOCKET_TYPE', AF_UNIX);
       //define('DPSERVER_SOCKET_TYPE', AF_INET);

       into:

       //define('DPSERVER_SOCKET_TYPE', AF_UNIX);
       define('DPSERVER_SOCKET_TYPE', AF_INET);

       Check if the DPSERVER_SOCKET_PORT is a free port on your
       machine (3333 by default):

       define('DPSERVER_SOCKET_PORT', '3333');

       Change the port number if necessary.

       Save the file.

       Edit the following file:

       c:\dutchpipe\config\dpuniverse-ini.php

       Change these two lines:

       define('DPUNIVERSE_MYSQL_USER', '&lt;youruser&gt;');
       define('DPUNIVERSE_MYSQL_PASSWORD', '&lt;yourpass&gt;');

       into:

       define('DPUNIVERSE_MYSQL_USER', 'root');
       define('DPUNIVERSE_MYSQL_PASSWORD', '');

       You should later secure MySQL by running the DutchPIPE database
       with another user and a password, but we're now just quickly
       getting up DutchPIPE locally.

       Save the file.

    6. Restart WAMP5

       Click on the WAMP5 tray bar icon and select at the bottom:

       Restart All Services

    7. Start the DutchPIPE Server

       Select at the bottom left of your screen:

       Start -&gt; Run...

       and enter the following line:

       c:\wamp\php\php.exe -c c:\wamp\apache2\bin c:\dutchpipe\script\start_dpserver.php

       The DutchPIPE server is now running in a Command Prompt window.

    8. Done

       Launch your web browser and go to:

       http://localhost/

       You should see the standard DutchPIPE environment, exactly like
       the demo on:

       http://demo.dutchpipe.org/
