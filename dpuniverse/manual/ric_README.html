WELCOME TO DUTCHPIPE

    With open source DutchPIPE software, web developers can make virtual
    multi-user environments. Each web page becomes an abstracted environment or
    location where visitors and other items on the page are visualized. This
    status is retained as visitors move around. A lot of real-time interaction
    is possible. The result: Persistent Interactive Page Environments. DutchPIPE
    uses AJAX and the DOM for the browser - it works without Java, Flash,
    plug-in or firewall adjustments. On the server, PHP 5 is used.

WARNING

    This is &quot;beta&quot; software. Beta-software has bugs and the usual disclaimers
    apply. This software is aimed at experienced developers.

INSTALLATION

    See the INSTALL file for installation requirements and step-by-step guides
    for both *NIX and Windows platforms.

DIRECTORY LAYOUT

    DutchPIPE has the following directory structure by default (directory
    locations can be changed):

    config/
        Configuration files

    dpuniverse/
        Your &quot;universe&quot;, you can build a site inside this directory without
        worrying much of what goes on beyond it

    lib/
        The DutchPIPE server/engine and other DutchPIPE components

    locale/
        Language files for internationalization and localization support

    public/
        Web enabled and publicly reachable directory

    script/
        DutchPIPE server startup script

    template/
        Templates for building XHTML pages

TROUBLESHOOTING/GETTING HELP/GIVING FEEDBACK

    DutchPIPE has been tested on a number of platforms, but obviously not all of
    them. Feel welcome to share your experiences or particular pains and
    problems with the DutchPIPE installation.

    See the MANUAL, DEVELOPER'S LOUNGE, MAILING LISTS and THE AUTHOR sections
    below for information and contact details. If you solved a particular
    installation problem, please also let us know, so the software and/or
    documentation can be updated.

MANUAL

    The DutchPIPE Manual is the DutchPIPE's developer prime source of
    information:

    http://manual.dutchpipe.org/

    This README file and the INSTALL file are copies from the manual's
    Introduction and Installation chapters, you might prefer the HTML pages.

HOMEPAGE

    For the latest releases, news, et cetera, see the DutchPIPE website at:

    http://dutchpipe.org/


DEVELOPER'S LOUNGE

    If you're experiencing problems, want to share ideas or just want to lay
    back and sip on hot coffee, visit the developers lounge at:

    http://dutchpipe.org/dpclient.php?location=/page/lounge.php

MAILING LISTS

    There are a number of DutchPIPE mailing lists, for instance to talk about
    DutchPIPE or to discuss installation problems. For an overview and to
    (un)subscribe, browse to:

    http://dutchpipe.org/mailman/

    If you're a serious developer, dutchpipe-talk is the best way to discuss
    issues.

THE AUTHOR

    DutchPIPE was made by Lennert Stock. Feel free to send comments and bug
    reports to the author at:

    mailto:ls@dutchpipe.org

ROADMAP

    A few of the things on the wish list:

    The interface is still crude and must be made more user friendly. The verb
    noun commands should only remain for power users and under the hood, input
    fields for communications should pop up or whatever.

    Debugging and making DutchPIPE more secure.

    Movable or even animated objects.

    Debugging and enhancements on running DutchPIPE on .html pages. Making it
    possible to run DutchPIPE on pages on another server. For this we need a
    proxy script to forward AJAX requests as AJAX cannot be used across domains
    for security reasons.

    Make options to let visitors make their own objects and &quot;area&quot;.

    Distributed DutchPIPE: Make it possible for DutchPIPE sites to see,
    communicate and switch to other DutchPIPE sites, making it one big,
    sprawling universe.

    Better dpuniverse/std library. The library provided for the universe is very
    basic now, and lots of functionality will be added.

    More showcases.

CONTRIBUTING

    If you'd like to contribute in any way, be it code, bugs or documentation,
    please mail ls@dutchpipe.org. The DutchPIPE &quot;noosphere&quot; is huge and for the
    taking. This will be a free project in any sense, if you shine at some
    particular skill or knowledge, you'll be able to pretty much give it shape
    any way you please.
